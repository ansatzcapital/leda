Static Widgets for IPython Notebooks
====================================

**Note that this package is no longer supported; instead, use IPython's built-in interactive tools: https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets**

This is currently an experimental repository containing code which enables
static widgets to be used in the IPython notebook.

Use at your own risk: the interface will likely change in the near future...

Demonstrations

You can see this in action in a few places:

- My [blog post](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/12/05/static-interactive-widgets/) about starting this repository
- The [example notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/ipywidgets/blob/master/example.ipynb) in this repository
